  <h3>Computers</h3>

  </a>
  <p>I've been fascinated with computers my whole life.  I first picked up on HTML when I was in sixth grade, and I was quickly hooked.  I read books on PHP, CSS, then C, Java, Haskell, Python, Ruby, etc.  I've continued my computer science studies at the University of Illinois, where I have found I most enjoy systems programming on Linux/Unix systems. Lately I have been working on learning how to submit Linux kernel patches.</p>

  <h3>Archery</h3>

  </a>
  <p>I've had a keen interest in archery since middle school, when I started taking lessons at the local range.  Despite the fact the range eventually closed, I held on to my interest and picked it up again at university.  Currently I shoot a 50lbs Bear Threat with a 10" BeeStinger stabilizer.  My quiver is a specially modified Easton Deluxe Field Quiver; I removed the quiver belt and replaced it with a velcro strap that fits around my legs, allowing the quiver to rest on my shoes.</p>

  <h3>Language Construction</h3>

  </a>
  <p>For as long as I can remember I have been inventing scripts and language.  Originally, the interest derived from my interest in cryptography, but it quickly took on a life of it's own when I started creating fantasy worlds where my languages could grow and be spoken.  Now I create complete languages, cultures, mythologies, and art in the world called <i>Quin</i>.  The figure to the right is an mystical animal figure called a <i>kahja</i>, which appears at several key points during Tam√©lin myth (notably the beginning and end of the world).</p>
