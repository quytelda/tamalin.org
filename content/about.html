<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am currently a Senior in computer science at the University of Illinois.  I am seeking a part-time or full-time position programming or working with GNU/Linux systems.  I have eleven years of programming experience and an extensive array of personal software projects; many are available on Github (<a href="http://github.com/quytelda">http://github.com/quytelda</a>). Lately I have been working on learning how to submit Linux kernel patches.</p>
